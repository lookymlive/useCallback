Usage Example
The PhoneBook component uses useCallback to memoize the makeCall function:
# PhoneBook Component with useCallback Example

## Description
This project demonstrates the usage of React's `useCallback` hook in a PhoneBook component to optimize performance by memoizing callback functions.

## Installation
```bash
npm install
npm run dev

Usage Example
The PhoneBook component uses useCallback to memoize the makeCall function:
const makeCall = useCallback((name: string) => setLog(`Llamando al ${name}`), [])
Code Explanation
The useCallback hook is used to prevent unnecessary re-renders by:

Memoizing the makeCall function
Only recreating the function when dependencies change (empty array means never recreate)
// Example implementation
import { useCallback, useState } from 'react'

export const PhoneBook = () => {
  const [contacts, setContacts] = useState([...])
  const [log, setLog] = useState<string>('')
  
  // makeCall function is memoized and only created once
  const makeCall = useCallback((name: string) => {
    setLog(`Llamando al ${name}`)
  }, [])
  
  // ... rest of component
}
Benefits
Prevents unnecessary re-renders of child components
Optimizes performance for components that rely on callback functions
Maintains referential equality between renders
